His channel is an absolute gold mine for anyone interested in philosophy.\n\nWe talk about the process of learning philosophy, the importance of good teachers, considerations about translated works, secondary literature, philosophical biases, truth, and much more. It was a very engaging conversation and one of my favorite episodes!",

He teaches courses on integrative/unified psychotherapy, personality, social, and cognitive psychology.
